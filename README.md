# About the exam

This course is designed for people who want to take the **CKA** examination.  
Which requires solving multiple hands-on tasks from a CLI within a 2-hour time limit.  
Candidates get two exam attempts (one free retake) and access to two Killer.sh simulators for practice.

# Why was Kubernetes invented?

In modern software development, applications are often packaged into lightweight portable units called containers.  
Managing hundreds or thousands of containers across a fleet of machines presents significant challenges.  

Kubernetes addresses these challenges by providing a robust framework for running distributed systems resiliently.  
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestrator that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.  

# Core Benefits of Kubernetes

## Self-healing

- automatically restarts failed containers
- replaces and reschedules containers when nodes die
- kills containers that fail health checks

## Automatic scaling

- scales applications up or down based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics

## Zero-Downtime Deployments

- facilitates rolling updates and rollbacks, ensuring service availability

# Core Philosophy: Declarative Configuration
